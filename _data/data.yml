      - title: Control systems project
        tagline: "BSc lab project as a part of Control Systems And Control Engineering. We used ADC converters, 
                  PLC and HMI to manage different types of actuators (control valves, frequency converters, etc.) 
                  based on feedback (pressure and vortex transmitters) and various control loop mechanisms. 
                  A master/slave PLC, decentralized computer and HMI display were interconnected and communicated 
                  via PROFIBUS DP and Ethernet."

      - title: Certificate of completed apprenticeship
        tagline: "For my examination as an automatician I created a test bench whose primary purpose was for future 
                  apprentices and employees to get acquainted with the hardware, software, etc. that existed at the
                  factory. The testbench incorporated sensors, servo motor/controller, pump, frequency converter, 
                  pneumatic cylinders, HMI and PLC."
