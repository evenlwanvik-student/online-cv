career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Earlier supervisors would say that I am a flexible and diligent, eager to engage with a new project or task. I am a structured 
      individual who plans his day/week around studies, gym, prepearing meals and friends. This is also reflected 
      
      FORTSETT HÆR!!
      
      When I am not working or studying I usually go to for a run or to the gym, play some video games, socialize or master 
      a new skill. I am an enormous fan of science and technology and new knowledge is digested with ease. My personal philosophy 
      in life is to live a healthy and enlightened lifestyle while enjoying the ride. 


education:
    - degree: 2-year MSc in Cybernetics and Robotics
      university: Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)
      time: 2018 - present
      details: |
        Cybernetics is the science of communications and automatic control systems.
        My main field of study is "Adpated Computer Systems", which involves a 
        further specialization in computer subjects (embedded systems, real-time- 
        and  analog/digital signal processing), projecting of instrumentation systems, 
        data communication, and communication.
        
          - Control theory, modeling and simulation
          - Embedded systems, RT, signal processing, comm.
          - Algorithms, networks, data structures
          

    - degree: BSc in Electrical Engineering (Automation and Control engineering)
      university: Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)
      time: 2014 - 2017
      details: |
        Typical assignments and projects involved control systems where different 
        types of coding, electronics, and mechanics (often referred to as mechatronics) 
        were employed. 

          - Control theory, Industrial automation, Maths/physics
          - PLC, HMI, industrial bus comm, Microcontrollers
          - Practical experience, Electronics

experiences:
    - role: Technical Student
      time: 2017 - 2018
      company: CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research), Geneva
      details: |
        For my main project, I played an important role in the improvement of the signal analysis
        for the Schottky beam measurement system that is currently deployed in the LHC (The
        Large Hadron Collider). The work involved liaising with the other teams and experts to
        understand current issues and future requirements, before implementing the improved
        algorithms using C++. Other side-projects included creating an off-line analysis tool for
        the logged measurement data in python and creating network protocol dissectors in C++
        to analyze the communication between measurement devices in the LHC.

          - BE-BI-SW (Beams Department - Beams Instrumentation - Software Section)

    - role: Security Officer
      time: 2013 - 2016
      company: PSS Securitas, Trondheim
      details: |
        Part time job while studying

          - Crime Prevention, managing threatening situations
          - Plan fire safety and emergency measures
          - Security for property

    - role: Automatician
      time: 2011 - 2016
      company: TINE, Trondheim
      details: |
        Apprentice for one and a half years, full time employee for six additional months after
        recieving my certificate of apprenticeship as a automatician (a branch of the electrician
        course in high school) and then worked part-time and as a summer substitute while
        studying. The work involved assembly, operation and maintenance of automated and signal 
        based control systems in the factory. I also acquired an adequite skillset in operating 
        mechanical equipment, for instance milling, lathe, etc.

        tagline: "MSc Lab project as a part of Linear System Theory. Employed control theory for optimal operation 
                  of a 3 DOF Helicopter and a simulated autonomous cargo ship."

        tagline: "MSc lab project as a part of Embedded and Industrial Computer Systems Design."

      - title: Control systems project
        tagline: "BSc lab project as a part of Control Systems And Control Engineering. We used ADC converters, 
                  PLC and HMI to manage different types of actuators (control valves, frequency converters, etc.) 
                  based on feedback (pressure and vortex transmitters) and various control loop mechanisms. 
                  A master/slave PLC, decentralized computer and HMI display were interconnected and communicated 
                  via PROFIBUS DP and Ethernet."

      - title: Certificate of completed apprenticeship
        tagline: "For my examination as an automatician I created a test bench whose primary purpose was for future 
                  apprentices and employees to get acquainted with the hardware, software, etc. that existed at the
                  factory. The testbench incorporated sensors, servo motor/controller, pump, frequency converter, 
                  pneumatic cylinders, HMI and PLC."
